# Analysing City School Data using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook

## Given Background
#### You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your local government area. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. As a first task, you've been asked to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. You'll be given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance. 

## Objectives
### A. To create a report that includes the data given below(1-9), using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.
### B. To analyse the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance and add to the report.

## Required Output Data includes:
#### 1. Local Government Area (LGA) Summary
#### 2. School Summary
#### 3. Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
#### 4. Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
#### 5. Maths Scores by Year
#### 6. Reading Scores by Year
#### 7. Scores by School Spending
#### 8. Scores by School Size
#### 9. Scores by School Type

### 1. Local Government Area (LGA) Summary

### To create a high-level snapshot of the local government area's critical metrics in a DataFrame including the following:
#### - Total number of unique schools
#### - Total students
#### - Total budget
#### - Average maths score
#### - Average reading score
#### - % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
#### - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
#### - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

### 2. School Summary

### To create a DataFrame that summarises key metrics about each school including the following:
#### - School name
#### - School type
#### - Total students
#### - Total school budget
#### - Per student budget
#### - Average maths score
#### - Average reading score
#### - % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
#### - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
#### - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

### 3. Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

#### - To sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows and save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

### 4. Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

#### - To sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows and save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

### 5. Maths Scores by Year

#### - To create a dataframe that lists the average maths score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

### 6. Reading Scores by Year

#### - To create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

### 7. Scores by School Spending

#### - To create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student) and Includes the following metrics:
#### - Average maths score
#### - Average reading score
#### - % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
#### - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
#### - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

### 8. Scores by School Size

#### - To create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large) and Includes the following metrics:
#### - Average maths score
#### - Average reading score
#### - % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
#### - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
#### - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

### 9. Scores by School Type

#### - To create a new DataFrame called type_summary that shows school performance based on the "School Type" and Includes the following metrics:
#### - Average maths score
#### - Average reading score
#### - % passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
#### - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
#### - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)
